    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This use case library contains a summary of the motivation behind the project, applicable ML methods and tools, the methods for data preparation, model development including the model training framework and evaluation, workflow management demonstrated using GeoWeaver, links to the complete model on GitHub as the model is data-intensive the tutorial is for a subset of the entire model, a discussion/conclusion, and a solitication to qestions.\n",
