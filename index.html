    <h1>Ryan Johnson PhD</h1>
    <p>
        Ryan Johnson is a Civil and Environmental Engineering doctoral graduate from the University of Utah, focusing his work on water system operations.
        He expands on this research at the Alabama Water Institute, seeking to characterize nonstationary affecting water supply and demand to enhance the management of water resources. 
        This builds on the understanding of snow & streamflow monitoring and prediction, and coupling with urban water systems operations. 
        Advancing this water resources research leverages state-of-the-art hydroinformatic sensor networks and remote sensing to characterize water use and availability, and integrate both physical and machine learning tools to advance complex modeling tasks.
        When not deep into python code, Ryan can be found exploring mountains with his mountain bike and fly rod in the summer or digging snow pits and skiing the famous Utah powder snow in the winter.
